 * This version is implemented as an array and a DoubleLinkList. There is less user data, so it is directly stored in an array.
 * The student data uses a DoubleLinkList, does not check the uniqueness of the student number and uses the simplest bubble sort (no time),
 * The DoubleLinkList is not circular, the next of the last node points to the NULL and does not point to the first node, 
 * except that it is the same as the DoubleCircularLinkList.
